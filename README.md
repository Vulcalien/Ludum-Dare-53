# Unfinished game for the Ludum Dare 53

The theme was 'Delivery'. The idea at first was to build a game about a
starship that delivers 'jokes' through the Internet, but it soon became
a classic scrolling shooter with no interesting mechanic.

However, I appreciated working on the GBA again, and the development
pace was not as slow as I was expecting.

The commit 'b022675' is a small template for GBA games: it could be
improved and used.
