Theme: Delivery

How about the delivery of a joke? Through space?

A starship must deliver the joke, which ends up on a chat with someone.
Similar to an upload, but from the starship's perspective, the Internet
is space.

The ship uses 'Joke Juice' as fuel and for the shields. By destroying
enemy ships, the player gains Joke Joke Juice.
